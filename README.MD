# Eye Movement Exercise
Just a heads up, he might be shy, and might give you a "look..." These eyes of an unknown, but adorable and cute pet will love to follow your mouse movements as you hover over different areas of the page. His eyes will hang on your every movement.
## How to Run

## Roadmap of future improvements
Next steps for future rollouts include a blinking function, maybe some eyelashes to go with the eyes. Other possible additions include a pair of lips that can smile and react as the mouse cursor moves, a nose that could execute scrunch and sniff movement reactions, and thought bubbles to directly state the thoughts and emotions the reactions are expressing.
